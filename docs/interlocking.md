# RailML 3.3 Interlocking Sub-Schema

This document covers the RailML 3.3 `interlocking` sub-schema — routes, signal aspects, track vacancy detection, overlaps, approach locking, and operational zones. For common primitives, see [railml.md](railml.md).

## UK / British Rail Terminology Mapping

| UK term | RailML equivalent | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Berth (track circuit section) | `TvdSection` | interlocking |
| Headcode / train description display | `TrainNumberField` on `TvdSection` | interlocking |
| TD stepping (headcode moves berth to berth) | `hasTrainNumberField` link on each `TvdSection` | interlocking |
| Berthing track (reversing siding) | `TvdSection/@isBerthingTrack` | interlocking |
| Overlap / braking distance | `Overlap` | interlocking |
| Partial route release / berth release | `RouteReleaseGroupRear` | interlocking |
| Junction indicator | `junctionIndicator` signal aspect | interlocking |
| Path-dependent signalling | `Route` with `routeEntry`/`routeExit` | interlocking |
| Track circuit | `TvdSection` with `technology="trackCircuit"` | interlocking |
| Axle counter section | `TvdSection` with `technology="axleCounter"` | interlocking |
| Fouling bar | `TrainDetectionElement` of mechanical type | infrastructure |
| TIPLOC | `Designator` with `register="TPLC"` | any |
| STANOX (TOPS) | `Designator` with `register="STNX"` | any |

The `isBerthingTrack` attribute (XSD annotation):

> *"True, if this section is part of a berthing track, i.e. track where trains may halt and change direction. Typically, an Interlocking assures that trains progress from section to section in an ordered sequence (aka. two/three phase release). This check would fail when a train changes direction. If this attribute is true, the interlocking doesn't carry out this check for this section."*

`junctionIndicator` and `distantJunctionIndicator` are built-in aspect enumeration values, covering path-dependent signalling where a signal shows a different aspect per set route.

Not in scope: the headcode string format itself (lives in the timetable sub-schema), real-time TD feed protocols (TRUST), and AWS/TPWS (not enumerated but the train-protection code lists are extensible).

## `tvdSection` — Track Vacancy Detection (Berths)

A TVD section is the interlocking's view of a track section — it reports occupied or vacant. In British signalling this is a **berth**.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `technology` | enum | `trackCircuit`, `axleCounter`, `insulatedRailJoint`, … |
| `frequency` | Hz | Track circuit frequency (0 = DC) |
| `isBerthingTrack` | boolean | True for sections where trains reverse — disables ordered phase-release check |
| `partialRouteReleaseDelay` | duration | Delay before a released section clears for re-use |
| `residualRouteCancellationDelay` | duration | Cleanup delay after abnormal train runs |

| Child | Description |
|---|---|
| `hasDemarcatingTraindetector` | Axle counters or insulated joints at the section boundaries |
| `hasExitSignal` | Signals delimiting the section exit (up to 2) |
| `hasDemarcatingBufferstop` | Buffer stops at track ends |
| `hasTrackElement` | Switches, crossings, etc. within the section |
| `hasTrainNumberField` | **Headcode display** associated with this berth |

---

## `trainNumberField` — Headcode Display (TD berth label)

`TrainNumberField` represents the physical or virtual display on the signaller's panel that shows the train's headcode as it steps through berths. Each `TvdSection` links to its label via `hasTrainNumberField`.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique identifier |
| `designator[]` | External identifiers for this display position |

---

## `signalIL` — Signal (Interlocking View)

`SignalIL` is the interlocking's logical view of a signal — distinct from the physical `SignalIS` in infrastructure. It expresses what the signal *does* rather than what it *looks like*.

| Attribute | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|

| `approachSpeed` | km/h | Speed at which a train should approach |
| `passingSpeed` | km/h | Maximum speed past the signal |
| `releaseSpeed` | km/h | Speed used to calculate overlap release |
| `sightDistance` | m | Distance from which the driver can read the signal |

| `restriction` | Speed indicator board |
| `repeating` | Repeats the aspect of the following signal |
| `dark` | Signal intentionally switched off |

---

## `route` — Route

| `additionalRelation` | Flank protection and other side conditions |

### `routeEntry` / `routeExit`

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `refersTo` | IDREF to a `SignalIL` (entry) or `SignalIL` / buffer stop (exit) |

### `switchAndPosition`

Used in `facingSwitchInPosition`, `trailingSwitchInPosition`, and overlap `requiresSwitchInPosition`.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `refersTo` | IDREF to a `SwitchIL` |
| `inPosition` | Required position: `left`, `right`, or `both` |

---

## `overlap` — Overlap (Braking Distance)

The overlap is the section of track beyond a stop signal that must remain clear to protect against a train overrunning — exactly the UK concept of the same name.

| Child | Description |
|---|---|
| `activeForApproachRoute` | Routes that use this overlap |
| `hasTvdSection` | TVD sections forming the overlap path |
| `requiresSwitchInPosition` | Switches that must be locked in the overlap |
| `overlapRelease` | Release conditions: timer, speed, section vacation |
| `additionalRelation` | Flank protection dependencies |

### `overlapRelease`

| Attribute/child | Description |
|---|---|
| `releaseTriggerSection` | IDREF to the `TvdSection` whose occupation starts the release timer |
| `overlapReleaseTimer[]` | One or more timers, each with a duration and optional conditions |

## `routeRelation` — Conditions on Route Setting

A route relation expresses additional prerequisites for a signal to clear — used for flank protection, approach locking, and interlocking between adjacent signal boxes.

| `requiredKeyLockState` | A key lock must be in a given state |

---

## `routeReleaseGroupRear` — Partial Route Release

As a train progresses forward, sections behind it can be released in groups rather than all at once. This is the RailML model of UK berth-by-berth (section-by-section) release.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|

Release can be triggered by:

| Trigger | Description |
